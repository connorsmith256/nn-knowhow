For large JSON:
```python
import json
import random
with open('datasets/bom.txt', 'r') as f:
    text_all = f.read()
n1 = int(0.9 * len(text_all))
text_train = text_all[:n1]
text_test = text_all[n1:]
context_length = 4096
step = 128
samples_train = [text_train[i:i+context_length] for i in range(0, len(text_train)-context_length+1, step)]
samples_test = [text_test[i:i+context_length] for i in range(0, len(text_test)-context_length+1, step)]
train = [{'text': t} for t in samples_train]
test = [{'text': t} for t in samples_test]
print(len(train), len(test))
with open(f'datasets/bom_11_{context_length}_{step}_train.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(train, f, indent=4)
with open(f'datasets/bom_11_{context_length}_{step}_test.json', 'w') as f:
