- 📜[Open-Ended Learning Leads to Generally Capable Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12808)
    - Defined a 3D "XLand" environment and used population based training (PBT) and generational training to improve agent fitness over time. Agents have a Goal Attention Module (GOAT) to structure, process, and attend to its goal. Agents achieved some amount of generalization on held-out tasks and finetuning for transfer
- 📰[A (Long) Peek into Reinforcement Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/)
    - Good overview of concepts, popular algorithms, and development over time. The reference to the "deadly triad" (bootstrapping, function approximation, off-policy training) leading to instability was helpful
- 📰[Stitching SAEs of different sizes](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/baJyjpktzmcmRfosq/stitching-saes-of-different-sizes)
    - Categorized features in larger vs smaller SAEs as "novel" vs "reconstruction" (sparsify) features. Mixing novel features from larger SAEs into smaller SAEs improved the performance of the smaller SAE. They also created "Frankenstein" SAEs by iteratively merging in novel features, achieving (slightly) better performance with smaller size
- 📰[SAEs (usually) Transfer Between Base and Chat Models](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fmwk6qxrpW8d4jvbd/saes-usually-transfer-between-base-and-chat-models)
    - Found that SAEs trained on base models perform well on chat models, and the gap can be closed further by fine-tuning the SAE. Seems to be further evidence that chat models' residual streams are very similar to base models
- 📰[An Introduction to Representation Engineering - an activation-based paradigm for controlling LLMs](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3ghj8EuKzwD3MQR5G/an-introduction-to-representation-engineering-an-activation)
    - No new information, but a great summary of the approach
- 📜[Prover-Verifier Games Improve Legibility Of LLM Outputs](https://cdn.openai.com/prover-verifier-games-improve-legibility-of-llm-outputs/legibility.pdf)
    - OpenAI trained provers (helpful and sneaky) and verifiers to investigate whether we can train models to produce accurate outputs that are legible to humans. Joint training resulted in a model that was more accurate than initialization and still legibile. The sneaky prover's inserted errors became more subtle over time. A model trained only for correctness had the highest performance (and poor legibility), indicating a "legibility tax" tradeoff between accuracy and legibility

- 📜[CRADLE: Empowering Foundation Agents Towards General Computer Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03186)
    - Fed screenshot/low-FPS video into GPT-4o. Scaffolded with self-reflection on inpupts, inference to select next task, learned & stored skills (code to interact with a mouse + keyboard), and episodic & procedural memory for improving performance over time. This framework was able to perform a variety of tasks in games/software with >50% success
- 📜[STaR: Self-Taught Reasoner Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14465)
    - Fine-tuned GPT-J-6B using STaR: starting with an initial few-shot prompt showing rationales, the model was trained to generate rationales to the input questions. Correct answer + rationale examples were added to the dataset. If the model wasn't able to come up with the right answer on its own, a hint was given in the form of the correct answer, and the model was able to generate a corresponding rationale. The process was iterated using the augmented dataset until performance plateaued. Performance after STaR was close to GPT-3 (30x larger), indicating models can "bootstrap" some amount of reasoning
- 📜[Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09629)
    - Generalizes the idea from STaR by having the model generate internal thoughts/rationales at each token position (in parallel), based off the preceding tokens. At the end of a thought, the post-rationale and base logits are mixed using a shallow MLP ("mixing head"). Rationales are optimized during training using REINFORCE, where the reward for a thought is based on how well it improves prediction of future tokens (the base future tokens are assumed to be ground-truth). Performance of Mistral 7B improved on GSM8K and CommonsenseQA, with "difficult" tokens benefiting more from internal reasoning. A future step could be dynamically determining when to generate/end thought, allowing a model to allocate variable compute during generation

07/12/2024
- 📖[Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville), Chapter 8](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
    - Chapter 8, Optimization: local minima in high-dimensional space are unlikely to be far from the global minimum, but saddle points are common, incentivizing optimization algorithms that can escape locally small gradients. Gradient clipping can prevent taking too large a step off a cliff. Momentum overcomes poor conditioning of the Hessian by using the gradient to update the momentum/velocity rather than the weights directly. Interesting to see the recommendation on treating weight initialization as a hyperparameter, as more recent texts have not
- 📖[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
    - Brushed through quickly. The visual explanation for why neural nets can approximate any function was nice. Both the vanishing and exploding gradient problems in deep networks result from the gradient in early layers being the product of terms from many later layers, leading to instability

07/11/2024
- 📖[Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville), Chapters 6-7](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
    - Chapter 6, Feedforward Networks: Historical coverage was really helpful, e.g. dominance of ReLU resulted from avoiding saturation & two-sided activations, cross-entropy improved over MSE's saturation/slow learning
    - Chapter 7, Regularization: Good coverage, esp. L2 as MAP Bayesian inference with a Gaussian prior on weights (discourages high weights) & L1 as the same but with a Laplace distribution prior (encourages sparsity). Also interesting to think of dropout as approximating bagging

07/10/2024
- 📖[Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville), Chapters 1-5](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
    - Revisited/brushed up on foundations

07/09/2024
- 📜[Me, Myself, and AI: The Situational Awareness Dataset (SAD) for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04694)
    - New benchmark for measuring situational awareness, composed of self-knowledge (facts, causal influence, mechanistic introspection), inferences (training vs. deployment stages, self-recognition of text authorship), & actions (leveraging knowledge of identity, avoiding pattern imitation). No models are currently close to saturation, but scores were higher than I expected

07/08/2024
- 📜[On scalable oversight with weak LLMs judging strong LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04622)
    - Compared debate to consultancy and direct question-answering for inference (not training). Debate outperforms consultancy, but QA with article access does significantly better than either. Obvious next steps are to train the debaters via self-play using the judge's decision as the reward signal
- 📜[Eureka: Human-Level Reward Design Via Coding Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12931)
    - Given RL environment code, an LLM (GPT-4) generates candidate reward functions. Each are simulated, and the LLM is given detailed performance statistics as feedback to iteratively generate a new batch of reward functions. After several iterations, the final reward function often outperforms one defined by human experts
- 📜[DrEureka: Language Model Guided Sim-To-Real Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01967)
    - Extends Eureka by generating reward functions that are (1) robust to domain randomization (DR) to account for real-world physics and (2) produce safer behavior. Feasible ranges on DR parameters to guide the LLM are learned via parallelized simulations. They achieved better than human-designed performance and got a robot dog to walk on a yoga ball for several minutes, without intermediate real-world testing
- 📰[An Extremely Opinionated Annotated List of My Favourite Mechanistic Interpretability Papers v2](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NfFST5Mio7BCAQHPA/an-extremely-opinionated-annotated-list-of-my-favourite)
    - Great summary from Nanda on latest mechinterp research. Pleased to see most of the papers he mentions are linked in this research log

07/06/2024
- 📜[Understanding Generalization through Visualizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03291)
    - Despite intuitions from the past, models do tend to generalize well to test data, perhaps because the loss landscape in high dimensions is mostly occupied by flat basins, leading to implicit regularization

07/05/2024
- 📜[Uncovering Latent Human Wellbeing In Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11777)
    - Used PCA to reduce dimensionality from embeddings and extract features relevant to wellbeing, using labeled prompts from ETHICS utilitarianism dataset. Small models represented wellbeing to an extent, bigger models did better
- 📜[When Representations Align: Universality in Representation Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09142)
    - Makes a case that given smooth encoder/decoder maps, high expressivity (enough model parameters/complexity), and small initial weights, structured representations (as opposed to overfitting) minimizes loss and is a natural consequence of gradient descent. Analysis & empirical data are limited to simple datasets & ignore inductive biases of models

07/03/2024
- 🌐[Intro to ML Safety, Lectures 13-14](https://course.mlsafety.org/index.html)
    - Lecture 13, Trojans: data poisoning of public datasets works even when a small fraction is poisoned. Open-weight models can also be manipulated. Anomaly detection, Neural Cleanse, & meta-networks can be used to detect trojans, but not 100% of the time
    - Lecture 14, Detecting Emergent Behavior: many examples of unanticipated capabilities emerging from more params/compute. Emergent, instrumentally convergent goals (e.g. self-preservation) are concerning for safety. Proxy gaming has emerged many times, and can sometimes be detected by comparing to a trusted policy
    - Lecture 15, Honest Models: assessing a model's "beliefs" is hard. Older models did poorly on TruthfulQA, but this lecture appears outdated, since modern RLHF models perform significantly better

07/02/2024
- 📖[AI Safety Book (Hendrycks), Chapters 8.1-8.9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JN7-ZGx9KLqRJ94rOQVwRSa7FPZGl2OY/view)
    - Covered uncertainty around timelines/takeoff speeds, economic growth, distribution of AI power, distribution of access. Discussed tradeoffs of open access (allowing bottom-up misuse) vs. tight control (allowing top-down misuse/lock-in). Compute is a natural target for governance since it's physical and quantifiable. Government and international cooperation will become increasingly important as risk increases.
- 🌐[Intro to ML Safety, Lectures 1-12](https://course.mlsafety.org/index.html)
    - Lectures 1-9: mostly recap/covered in safety book
    - Lecture 10, Anomaly Detection: AUROC, AUPR, FPR95 can all be used to evaluate anomaly detection. (Negative) prediction confidence can be used for anomaly detection, but isn't robust to adversarial inputs. Outlier exposure can help detect unseen OOD examples/anomalies. Training on geometric transformations (rotation, translation) can also help
    - Lecture 11, Interpretable Uncertainty: modern NNs are miscalibrated (often overconfident), especially on OOD data. Temperature scaling (fixed, post-training) & ensembles can significantly reduce calibration error.
    - Lecture 12, Transparency: covered saliency maps & feature visualization. Good reminder that a lot of interpretability work (on transformers) is less than two years old!

07/01/2024
- 📖[AI Safety Book (Hendrycks), Chapters 7.1-7.7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JN7-ZGx9KLqRJ94rOQVwRSa7FPZGl2OY/view)
    - Covered game theory, cooperation/conflict, collective action problems, & evolutionary pressures. The most salient idea is maliciousness from AI systems is not even necessary for bad outcomes for humans; rationality and selection pressure is enough

06/28/2024
- 📜[Confidence Regulation Neurons in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16254)
    - LLMs have "entropy neurons" which can modify the output distribution without directly impacting the logits, and "frequency neurons," which directly modify logits along the direction of the token frequency distribution. Reproduced from GPT-2 small up to Llama 7B (entropy neurons) and Pythia 1B (frequency neurons)

- 📜[LLM Critics Help Catch LLM Bugs](https://cdn.openai.com/llm-critics-help-catch-llm-bugs-paper.pdf)
    - OpenAI trained CriticGPT for scalable oversight. Started with GPT4, used RLHF pipeline: human-rated critiques of (question, answer) data, used to train a reward model, optimized a policy with PPO, with Force Sampling Beam Search (FSBS) to reduce rate of hallucinations/nitpicks. CriticGPT outperforms humans and ChatGPT

06/27/2024
- 🧪[Implemented PPO for GridWorld](./projects/rl_gym/ppo.py)
    - When the agent can find a solution, it converged much more quickly and stably than DQN. Still surpisingly fails to solve some seeds with bad obstacle configurations/sparser reward

06/26/2024
- 🧪[Implemented DQN for GridWorld](./projects/rl_gym/dql.py)

- 📜[Connecting the Dots: LLMs can Infer and Verbalize Latent Structure from Disparate Training Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14546)
    - inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR): infer value of latent information during (finetuning) training. High variance, but better than ICL. GPT-4 did better than GPT-3.5
- 📰[Attention Output SAEs Improve Circuit Analysis](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/EGvtgB7ctifzxZg6v/attention-output-saes-improve-circuit-analysis)

- 📖[Foundational Challenges in Assuring Alignment and Safety of Large Language Models](https://llm-safety-challenges.github.io/challenges_llms.pdf)
    - Notable: the nature of ICL is unknown, capabilities are not human-shaped, forecasting from scaling is hard, agents pose unique risks, finetuning is mostly superficial, evals are making progress but not robust enough, interp is a big challenge and can be misleading, jailbreaks are way too easy, data poisoning/backdoors are theoretically scary, it's not clear what value alignment means, capabilities are dual-use, governance is lagging capabilities
